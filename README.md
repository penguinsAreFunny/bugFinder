# Description
This is a MonoRepository which aims to automatically find bugs in source code  
based on software-metrics.

This package contains all programms needed to run to generate a learning dataset.  
It uses partial implementations of the bugFinder-framework which are placed in  
the packages directory. You can find these packages on npm, too.   

This package uses [bugFinder-framework](#https://github.com/penguinsAreFunny/bugFinder-framework)
and implementation-packages of bugFinder-framework-interfaces.
